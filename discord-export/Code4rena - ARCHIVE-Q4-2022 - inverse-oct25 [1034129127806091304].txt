Hi there! Which chainlink feeds are you going to use? Couldn't find them in the docs.


[10/26/2022 02:54] 0xmt
For launch we'll most likely only use the ETH feed, but it should be treated as any feed conforming to the interface.


[10/26/2022 03:00] raoul.schaffranek
Got it!


[10/26/2022 03:03] raoul.schaffranek
Just to be sure that I understand correctly: So, if the collateral is WETH, the ETH/USD-feed would be an appropriate choice?


[10/26/2022 03:03] 0xmt
Yes exactly, every feed should be USD denominated.

The final numbers for these parameters have not been decided, and may be different from market to market, but assuming something like:
CollateralFactorBps = 8000 //80%
ReplenishmentIncentiveBps = 500 //5%
liquidationIncentiveBps = 1000 //10%
liquidationFee = 500 //5%
Would make for a realistic example.

{Reactions}
➕ 

[10/26/2022 08:01] 0xmt
Escrows are deployed to deterministic addresses that are unique to the (address user, address market) pair. The  `predictEscrow()` function uses this to calculate the address of an escrow rather than look it up in a map, saving some gas costs.

I just want to better understand the system.


[10/26/2022 21:37] ladboy233
As time progresses, DBR will be burnt from the borrower's wallet at a rate that depends on their debt


[10/26/2022 21:37] ladboy233
What does this mean?


[10/26/2022 21:38] ladboy233
User  who own DBR can borrow DOLA?


[10/26/2022 21:39] ladboy233
The Fed attached to FiRM protocol markets lend DOLA to the markets by expanding supply, and contracts supply by recalling dola from the markets.


[10/26/2022 21:39] ladboy233
Srry I have trouble understanding this as well.

What does the burning mean in the context of the debt 🙂


[10/26/2022 21:40] pedr02b2
i assumed it meant there is a rate/time calculation somewhere


[10/26/2022 21:41] pedr02b2
as in it can burn decimals of the token to negative as well if im readin this right


[10/26/2022 21:41] pedr02b2
cant seem to see where the math is for this though or how its worked out

this is the function with the DBR burn calculation. it costs 1 DBR to borrow 1 DOLA for 1 year

Is this diagram means that the user can deposit ETHin escrow contract, then borrow or repay via market contract.


[10/26/2022 21:44] ladboy233
market contract interact with Price oracle, borrow controller and DOLA fee.

how does this branch fit in? 🙂


[10/26/2022 21:48] yellowtail#9857
Yes, but the diagram is a bit misleading there. deposits into the escrow will mostly be done through the `deposit()` function on the Market.sol contract, but it is possible to send collateral to an escrow directly.

[10/26/2022 21:52] yellowtail#9857
https://github.com/InverseFinance/FiRM-code4rena/blob/main/src/DBR.sol#L284

this is the DBR burn rate function. this is called whenever a user interacts with most functions in Market.sol. it means burning the user's DBR tokens based on how much DOLA they have borrowed from Markets and how much time has passed. `debt` is the total amount of DOLA debt the address has across all markets

[10/26/2022 22:22] chaduke3730
Just try to get the whole picture. What is the purpose of DBR? If I already put my WETH into the escrow as collatoral, the lender should not be worried. Why is holding DBR still necessary?


[10/26/2022 22:30] cryptphi
Is the chair an EOA or a contract? If a contract, please share a link for reference.... many thanks.


[10/26/2022 22:35] yellowtail#9857
it can be thought of like an interest rate. 1 DBR lets you borrow 1 DOLA for 1 year. So if 1 DBR costs 0.01 DOLA, the annual interest rate is 0.01/1, or 1%.

{Reactions}

[10/26/2022 22:37] yellowtail#9857

cool, thanks

{Reactions}
🤝 

[10/27/2022 00:29] 0xmt
To expand on this point, this is what allows the system to be fixed rate, as a user can buy enough DBR to cover their expected loan period at a price that is known to them. For example, if you know you want to borrow 10,000 DOLA for 2 years, you can buy 20,000 DBR right now, to lock in your interest rate.


[10/27/2022 01:05] chaduke3730
@yellowtailI see, so one needs to have both escrow (to deal with default) and DBR (to pay interests)


[10/27/2022 01:10] chaduke3730
One more question:  who will be the lender of a market? Is it always the fed contract?

@0xMT


[10/27/2022 01:39] chaduke3730
What is the idea of multiple markets?  I understand interest rate is the same (controlled by the price of DBR, which is controlled by the real market), for different collateral tokens?


[10/27/2022 01:42] 0xmt
Primarily it's to allow for:
1. Being able to set different parameters for different markets (CF, liquidation incentives etc.)
2. Being able to use different escrows for different markets.
Of course, something similar can be accomplished in a multi-market contract, but we think this is a neater separation and saves some mapping look-ups.


[10/27/2022 01:46] chaduke3730
That makes sense (different policies for different markets) Thanks. I agree. Such separation of concern is a good principle -it is just a lot of escrow bytecode will be duplicated - imagine escrow bytecode needs to be upgraded one day


[10/27/2022 01:51] 0xmt
The great thing about minimal proxies is that each deployment of an escrow takes up a very small amount of bytecode, and just uses a reference implementation.  I agree that it may require a lot of redeployed escrows if an upgrade needs to be made to a market or escrow contract, but I believe it can be done fairly seamlessly by simply halting the supply of new DOLA to the deprecated market, and recalling what's left in it, before deploying the upgraded contracts.
The deprecated market would then slowly fall out of use, as borrowers eventually repay their debt. In that way we get to have limited upgradeability, without using a dangerous/sketchy upgradeable proxy pattern.


[10/27/2022 01:55] chaduke3730
Agree. The proxy pattern should be avoided when possible


[10/27/2022 01:58] chaduke3730
@0xMTCan you share how much gas is needed to deploy one escrow contract right now?


[10/27/2022 01:59] 0xmt
Should be about 65k gas


[10/27/2022 01:59] chaduke3730
Thanks for sharing


[10/27/2022 02:03] 0xmt
Might actually be quite a bit cheaper. Worst case gas cost for depositing is 123215 gas, which includes deploying an escrow + token transfers.


[10/27/2022 02:03] chaduke3730
I see.. thanks


[10/27/2022 04:13] carlitox477
So, someone pays for the right to take a loan for 1 DOLA by giving 1 DBR, the price someone pays this DBR is the interest. In some way, is it like paying the interest in advance?


[10/27/2022 04:15] 0xmt
Yep! Though assuming liquid DBR markets, a loan may be terminated before the borrower run out of DBR, and the remaining DBR can be sold to recoup some interest cost (may even make a profit if interest rates / DBR price have risen).

Hey @0xMT , can you elaborate more on the markets? Who/what is eligible to be a market? is it only the contracts that Inverse Finance mints DOLA to?


[10/27/2022 07:17] 0xmt
Exactly, ultimately a market won't be worth anything unless there's a lender to fund it, and in the FiRM protocol Inverse is the only lender.


[10/27/2022 08:50] 0xsorrynotsorry
So what is the criteria to whitelist a market in the FiRM? Let's say a new built defi space lists DOLA, would it be eligible to be minted more to?


[10/27/2022 09:09] 0xmt
Would definitely need a thorough review. Right now the plan is for Inverse to be the sole deployer of new markets.


[10/27/2022 09:37] ch_301
@0xMT What is the supposed value of `callOnDepositCallback` ? and what are the differences between `true` & `false`?


[10/27/2022 09:40] 0xmt
A boolean indicating whether or not the Market should call the `onDeposit()` function in the Escrow when depositing. True is yes, false is no.


[10/27/2022 09:44] ch_301
so in case `callOnDepositCallback == false` the `INV` will not be converted into `xINV` tokens!!


[10/27/2022 09:44] 0xmt
Yep, exactly.

If you’re borrowing $1k dola using ETH as collateral. ETH price is $1k. Collateral factor is 50%. If you have less than 2 ETH as collateral you will be liquidated


[10/27/2022 11:01] 0xmt
To add to what Nour said, the `liquidationFactorBps` sets how much of a user's position can be liquidated in a single liquidation, which is set to 50% by default.


[10/27/2022 11:02] koolexc
Thank you  @Nour @0xMT !


[10/27/2022 11:04] c7e7eff
So both `liquidationFactorBps` and `collateralFactorBps` would be 50% with current estimates ? Would it be possible to give probable ranges, cause they won't ever be close to 0% or close to 100% I presume.


[10/27/2022 11:10] 0xmt
`collateralFactorBps` is complicated to set, and depends on the volatility and liquidity of the underlying ERC20. `LiquidationFactorBps` should be as low as possible, as long as it remains feasible to liquidate the vast majority of positions.
For a WETH market,  `collateralFactorBps = 8000` and `liquidationFactorBps = 5000` would be a reasonable assumption. Over all, `collateralFactorBps` is unlikely to exceed 90% for assets that aren't heavily correlated with DOLA, and `liquidationFactorBps` should be 50% in the vast majority of markets, unless there's a very good reason to change it.


[10/27/2022 11:11] 0xmt
As for lower bounds on `collateralFactorBps`, it's hard to tell, but it likely won't be set below 20%, as there wouldn't be much point in being a borrower for something paltry like that.

[10/27/2022 11:49] nourharidy

hi. I am trying to understand the `forceReplenish` function. It says, "user being forced to replenish DBR". But I see that only internal variables are incremented and no actual tokens are transferred from user. The user might not know he was `forced` to replenish. Is that right understanding? 

Is this an idea similar to liquidation?


[10/27/2022 14:46] koolexc

[10/27/2022 14:57] 0xmt
It's similar to liquidations, but happens when a user runs out of DBR. Instead of being immediately liquidated, the user is forced to buy DBR from the protocol at a high price.


[10/27/2022 15:01] 0xmt
credit limit is simply calculated as `collateralValue * collateralFactor / 10000`, meaning it's the maximum amount of DOLA a user can borrow.


[10/27/2022 15:02] 0xmt
xINV is staked INV

@0xMTFollwoing your example of having 2 WETH with $1K/weth ,  collateralFactorBps = 8000 and liquidationFactorBps = 5000, ho much dola can I borrow? When will I get liquidated?


[10/27/2022 15:05] 0xmt
Depends on the lowest prices logged in the oracle in the past two days and the current price of WETH, but likely somewhere around 80% the value of your collateral.


[10/27/2022 15:06] koolexc
Thanks. meaning that, it would be different for each user as the collateralValue would be different


[10/27/2022 15:06] 0xmt
Yes exactly, unless the users somehow managed to deposit the exact same amount of collateral, ofc 😄

{Reactions}
😆 

[10/27/2022 15:07] chaduke3730
@0xMTso that means I can borrow up to 1600 of Dola.


[10/27/2022 15:08] 0xmt
Yep, exactly


[10/27/2022 15:08] chaduke3730
but with 5000 liquidationFactorBps, will I get liquidated immediately?


[10/27/2022 15:10] chaduke3730
I feel collactoralFactorsBPs must be small than liquidationFActorsBps


[10/27/2022 15:11] 0xmt
LiquidationFactor sets the maximum amount of your collateral that can be liquidated, so 1000$ worth of WETH in this case


[10/27/2022 15:11] 0xmt
But that's only if you fall below your credit limit


[10/27/2022 15:11] chaduke3730

[10/27/2022 15:15] chaduke3730
In my exmaple, I can borrow up to 1600 dola, but if weth prices drop a bit, 50% of my collatoral will be liquidated

Having unpaid debt continuously burns DBR from a user. If a user falls below 0, they will start incurring a DBR deficit.

[10/27/2022 15:24] 0xmt
DBR deficits can be force replenished, which is an action similar to liquidations, where a borrower is forced to take on more DOLA debt to pay for DBR minted to them to make up for their deficit.

I'm asking out of curiosity. is it to give a second chance to the users?


[10/27/2022 15:26] elku.cryptos
and as the debt increases his collateral value decreases, which eventually makes his debt eligible for liquidation?


[10/27/2022 15:27] 0xmt
Yeah, it's an alternative to just liquidating the user outright, but the additionally incurred debt may cause a liquidation in the future, if the user don't take care of their debt in some way.

{Reactions}
thankyou chefskiss (2) 

[10/27/2022 15:28] nourharidy
forceReplenishment is meant as a deterrent. Otherwise there would be no reason to buy DBR/pay interest. In the original implementation, DBR deficit caused the user’s collateral to be liquidatable. Force replenishment was introduced as a softer alternative

It would have to be high enough to be both punitive and reliably higher than the market price. 10000 would likely be a good example, which would be similar to a 100% APR

I think I get the whole picture, however I can't understand who will control the supply of DBR. 
So let's say I deposit some collateral and take a loan, that will immediately start accruing debt in the DBR contract and get me in deficit, meaning I need to have some DBR. But DBR minting (or not privileged minting) is only possible through a forced replenishment. 
Who will generate the market for DBR tokens? Will you mint tokens and setup an initial pool? 
Also, who will burn them? there's a public unprotected burn function. Are there any incentives to burn DBR?


[10/29/2022 05:25] c7e7eff

The chair role is the address allowed to expand and contract DOLA through that specific fed contract.


[10/29/2022 12:59] 0xmt
Basically the guy operating the money printer.

It'll most likely be a multisig operated by Inverse Finance

I see, thanks


[10/29/2022 14:15] PaludoX0#9748
@0xMT Could you help me understanding the difference between debts[user] and dueTokensAccrued[user] in DBR.sol?


[10/29/2022 15:37] koolexc
What is the DBR deficit that's beyond negligible dust amounts? trying to understand the extent of (negligible).


[10/29/2022 15:50] 0xmt
One is the user dola debt, the other is burned dbr


[10/29/2022 15:52] 0xmt
Anything that'd have a material impact on protocol earnings. It's hard to define in exact measures, but a few dollars worth are probably acceptable while, more starts to become harmful.

[10/29/2022 16:43] koolexc
What will be the decimals of DOLA? I see in the contract for testing, it is set to 18. Is it the same when going live?


[10/29/2022 16:46] codingnamekiki
DOLA is already existing stablecoin

A general question, when actually the Fed is supposed to receive profit?


[10/29/2022 17:47] koolexc
trying to understand the marketValue and how it can affect the Fed profit?


[10/29/2022 17:48] koolexc
@0xMT


[10/29/2022 18:44] koolexc
from what I understand the market value should be greater than the initial supply to get profit


[10/29/2022 18:45] koolexc
but how is this explained conceptually from business point of view?


[10/29/2022 20:19] koolexc
Anyone available ?

Hi sers, how to manipulate timestamps on Foundry tests?


[10/29/2022 21:32] horsefacts
https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/warp


[10/29/2022 21:35] koolexc
`vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);`


[10/29/2022 21:35] koolexc
just an example for 1 day .. but you can change it to whatever


[10/29/2022 21:44] 0xRobocop#3994
thanks man


[10/29/2022 22:04] saksham#7993
Are the escrow contracts in scope?


[10/29/2022 22:04] nourharidy
Only in the case where someone is forceReplenished (see line 508 in Market.sol) and their dola debt is increased over the originally borrowed amount


[10/29/2022 22:05] nourharidy
Or if someone sends extra dolas to the market contract for some reason then it can be claimed as profit


[10/29/2022 22:05] nourharidy
It’s just to ensure any extra dolas are not burned during contractions and are collected by governance instead


[10/29/2022 22:26] koolexc
Sure


[10/29/2022 22:26] koolexc

when will the results of the public report be? we need transparency where did it go wrong report


[12/08/2022 01:42] carlitox477
@xyzbtchunt there is almost never an exact date, it maybe we'll be 1 month. However, if you've found 3 mediums/highs you can apply to become a certified warden, which will allow you to see the judging process and do you reclaim in the correct place. The process, at least from my pov, is transparent.


[12/08/2022 01:43] carlitox477
Believe me that if you put time and effort you can get 3 mediums/high in one month

Hey @Jay | C4 in the github repo above I see my name twice which I don't understand because I only submitted one qa but even weirder is that my name is not included in the award mentions that just got mentioned. P.S. Not talking about the red in the github, with the red in mind my name shows up 4 times.

Cool. Might be an updated PR but it's not a different contest as it both states Inverse and there was no other Inverse ongoing from what I'm aware of or that I contributed. From what I could see if I divided the first mention in the repo by 2 I get the second mention albeit exactly 1.30 dollars more in the repo than what the math states and now it's somehow 100% disputed. In any case, I guess it is what it is.

Hi there - I've looked into this, and from what I'm seeing, the issue that was marked `satisfactory` was grouped with a set of duplicates that were assigned a C grade by the judge. The `satisfactory` label should have been removed automatically, but was not. 

The upshot is that it was graded as a C and therefore not eligible for awards. 

As a backstage warden, you should have sufficient access privileges to click through to the set of dupes and understand the judge's decision process. Hope this helps.

@CloudEllie - away I've same issue. I'm aware that my submissions were not the best ones, but on previous contests similar submissions were accepted. Anyway I've spent some time on this contest and I would like to understand why they have been discharged to learn for the future. I'm not a backstage warden. Is there any chance to check reasons?

The best way for you to check on this is after the findings repo is made public. We're doing our best to shorten the lag time between award announcements and publishing reports. Super appreciate your patience in the meantime!

I cannot see one of my findings in the report at all, not even downgraded. And this one I consider the most severe

Thank you!

I think https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-inverse-findings/issues/128 was incorrectly judged as QA. It was a duplicate of https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-inverse-findings/issues/395 which was first downgraded as QA but then bumped back up to M after consulting the sponsor. The sponsor implemented the fix recommended in 128. Same goes for https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-inverse-findings/issues/396 but this one might have come from the same warden as 395.
